This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project written by Abdul Ghani Raheem for a test demonstration

This focus on fullstack NextJs App.

Goal of this was to build a simple store application using Next.js and TypeScript.  

Also I have tried to get all the bonus points as much as possible.


Note: ChatGtp was not used on this project to keep it fair and to showcase my real knowledge.
